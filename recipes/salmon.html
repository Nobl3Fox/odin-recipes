    <h1>Salmon</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I looked for a recipe for glazed salmon and didn't find one that used the ingredients I had on hand.<br> 
            So I threw together what I had and came up with this tangy, spicy sweet marinade that adds flavor, <br>
            but doesn't mask the flavor of the salmon. My kids and sister loved it. <br>
            They said it was better than 'restaurant salmon' It's great served with wild rice and stir fried veggies.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds fresh salmon fillet with skin removed</li>
        <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>⅓ cup brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place salmon in a shallow, flat dish, and set aside. <br>
            Combine the vinegar, olive oil, soy sauce, water, lemon juice, red pepper flakes, <br>
            onion powder, garlic powder, cilantro, and brown sugar in a blender. <br>
            Blend until brown sugar dissolves. Pour the marinade over the salmon to cover evenly. <br>
            Cover the dish, and refrigerate at least 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line a broiling pan with foil. Remove salmon from marinade, <br>
            and place on prepared broiling pan; season to taste with salt and pepper. <br>
            Transfer remaining marinade to a saucepan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn on broiler to low.
        </li>
        <li>
            Broil salmon about 6 inches from the heat for 5 minutes; brush with remaining marinade. <br>
            Broil an additional 5 to 10 minutes, brushing 2 or 3 more times with additional marinade. <br>
            Salmon is done when fish is no longer bright red and can be flaked with a fork.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, cook the remaining marinade over low heat until it thickens <br>
            and reduces by one-third, 5 to 10 minutes. <br>
            Use cooked marinade as a dipping sauce or drizzle over salmon just before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
